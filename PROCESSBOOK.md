Originally, we wanted to investigate misbeliefs and how they grow to popularity. However, we soon understood that this is hard to do as it is hard, if not impossible, to tell whether a societal belief is false. Of course, it is possible to prove some misbeliefs wrong but it is hard to discern what is a misbelief and what is just a different opinion. Hence, we did not want to be know-it-alls while we are not.

However, what we discovered during our research is that there are many international and non-governmental instituions that are covered in the media.
